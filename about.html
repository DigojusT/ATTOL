        <h1>About The Technique of Learning by Teaching</h1>
        <p>One powerful method for mastering a topic is to study it with the intention of teaching it to someone else.
            This approach, often called the Feynman Technique, turns passive learning into active engagement by forcing
            you to simplify and clarify what you've learned. It helps identify gaps in your understanding and
            strengthens memory retention. This can be broken down into three key steps: <span
                style="font-weight: bolder;">Search</span>, <span style="font-weight: bolder;">Teach</span>, and <span
                style="font-weight: bolder;">Learned</span>.</p>
        <h2>Search: Explore and Gather Knowledge</h2>
        <p>The first step is to search for information. This involves reading books, watching videos, taking notes, and
            asking questions about the topic. It’s important not just to collect facts, but to truly try to understand
            them. During this phase, curiosity drives the learning process. The more active your search, the more
            material you’ll have to work with when it's time to explain.</p>
        <h2>Teach: Explain it Simply</h2>
        <p>Once you’ve collected and understood the material, the next step is to teach it. Try explaining the concept
            to someone else in your own words, without using jargon. If no one is available, explain it out loud to
            yourself or write it down as if teaching. The goal is to simplify the topic as much as possible. When you
            struggle to explain something clearly, it often reveals what you don’t fully understand yet.</p>
        <h2>Learned: Fill the Gaps and Reinforce</h2>
        <p>Finally, reflect on what you were able to explain and where you got stuck. This is the learned phase. Go back
            to your sources, review the unclear parts, and try again. Every time you repeat the process, your
            understanding becomes clearer and deeper. Over time, this loop of learning and teaching solidifies knowledge
            and builds confidence.</p>
        <p>By using the <span style="font-weight: bolder;">Search</span> → <span
                style="font-weight: bolder;">Teach</span> → <span style="font-weight: bolder;">Learned</span> cycle, you
            turn studying into a dynamic and interactive process. It’s not just about memorizing — it’s about
            understanding deeply enough to share it with others.</p>
